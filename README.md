# MAP-Me: Managing Anchor-less Producer Mobility in Content-Centric Networks
## Source code

This folder contains all the code needed to reproduce the results from the
paper. It includes a homemade graph simulator as well as the comprehensive
simulation environment based on ndnSIM 2.1 and used in the paper for both
synthetic and trace-based experiments.

We assume our patched versions of ns-3 and ndnSIM have been installed. A helper
script `setup-env.sh` is provided to bootstrap a full simulation envionment,
either system-wide or within the user's home directory.

## Work in progress
