The simulator is written in Python. A more efficient alternative would be to
resort to the Boost Graph Library, but we chose the former due to the
availability of several helper packages for graph algorithms (netwrkx),
artificial topology generation and topology parsers (fnss).

SETUP
=====

./setup.sh deps
./setup.sh data

SIMULATIONS
===========

./mobisim.py [optional args: todo]

PLOTS
=====

./scripts/plot_results.R
ls plots/*.svg

TOPOLOGY INFORMATION
====================

Information is plotted during simulation with mobisim.

For original graph information from map files, you can also use the following
command:

  shopt -s nullglob
  for i in data/rocketfuel/maps/*.r0.cch; do echo $i; ./scripts/rocketfuel-info.py $i; done
